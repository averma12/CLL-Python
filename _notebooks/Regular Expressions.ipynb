    "Regex or regular expressions is in many ways a language within a language. It has its own syntax. It is used extensively in pattern matching. Many programmers make one of two mistakes regarding __regex__ , either they overuse it on every problem or they completely steer clear of it. To be honest , I'm not a fan of regexes. But as a machine learning engineer, you also need to spend a lot of work analyzing and cleaning the data to find patterns on it. You even need to scrape data from sites sometimes. These are places where knowledge of regular expressions comes in handy. So hopefully, this blog of my notes on learning regex can help a novice to navigate the complex world of regex. Even if your job doesn't involve working with data everyday, you will come across some regex code written by someone else , hence a knowledge of regex is vital. "
